# ============================================================================
#
# The Julian Day Count is a uniform count of days from a remote epoch in the
# past (-4712 January 1, 12 hours Greenwich Mean Time (Julian proleptic
# Calendar) = 4713 BCE January 1, 12 hours GMT (Julian proleptic Calendar) =
# 4714 BCE November 24, 12 hours GMT (Gregorian proleptic Calendar)). At this
# instant, the Julian Day Number is 0. It is convenient for astronomers to use
# since it is not necessary to worry about odd numbers of days in a month,
# leap years, etc. Once you have the Julian Day Number of a particular date
# in history, it is easy to calculate time elapsed between it and any other
# Julian Day Number.
#
# The Julian Day Count has nothing to do with the Julian Calendar introduced by
# Julius Caesar. It is named for Julius Scaliger, the father of Josephus Justus
# Scaliger, who invented the concept. It can also be thought of as a logical
# follow-on to the old Egyptian civil calendar, which also used years of
# constant lengths.
#
# Scaliger chose the particular date in the remote past because it was before
# recorded history and because in that year, three important cycles coincided
# with their first year of the cycle: The 19-year Metonic Cycle, the 15-year
# Indiction Cycle (a Roman Taxation Cycle) and the 28-year Solar Cycle (the
# length of time for the old Julian Calendar to repeat exactly).

### function DatetoJD(Y::Int, M::Int, D::Int, h::Int, m::Int, s::Int)

Convert a date represented using the Gregorian Calendar (Year = `y`, Month =
`M`, Day = `D`, Hour = `h`, minute = `m`, and second = `s`) to Julian Day.

##### Args

* Y: Year in Gregorian Calendar.
* M: Month in Gregorian Calendar (`1` => **January**, `2` => **February**, ...).
* D: Day in Gregorian Calendar.
* h: Hour (0 - 24).
* m: Minutes.
* s: Seconds.

##### Returns

The Julian Day.

##### Remarks

The algorithm was obtained from [2] (Accessed on 2018-04-11).

### function JDtoDate(JD::Number)

Convert a date represented in Julian Day `JD` to Gregorian Calendar.

##### Args

* JD: Julian Day.

##### Returns

* Year.
* Month (`1` => **January**, `2` => **February**, ...).
* Day.
* Hour (0 - 24).
* Minute (0 - 59).
* Second (0 - 59) (**NOTE**: The seconds are computed and then rounded).

##### Remarks

The algorithm was obtained from [2] (Accessed on 2018-04-11). In [2], there is
the following warning:

> Note: This method will not give dates accurately on the Gregorian Proleptic
> Calendar, i.e., the calendar you get by extending the Gregorian calendar
> backwards to years earlier than 1582. using the Gregorian leap year rules.
> In particular, the method fails if Y<400.
